_# Books Library (C)

:blue_book: :orange_book: :green_book: This is an application written in **C** during the first year at my university. It provides functionality in order to add, remove, rate a book *(Title, Author, etc.)* and add it to your personal library. You can also **save** and **load** the list of the books. :blue_book: :orange_book: :green_book:
